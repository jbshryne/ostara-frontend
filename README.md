# Ostara Tree Crystals (Blog Site)

<!-- Live Site: <onRender address> -->

For my Project #4, I decided to build a companion "shell" site (focusing on the Blog) for my wife's online crystal and jewelry retial store.

## Technologies Used

### Frotend:

- React
- React Router
- CSS

### Backend:

- Django
- Django REST Framework
- PostgreSQL

## Unfinished Features

- The last thing I did was start to add & integrate Tags to group blog posts by topic. I was able to add the Tag model to the backend, and the frontend currently displays the tags for each post. I would like to add the ability to click on a Tag and see all the posts that have that Tag, as well as add & edit tags for each post (for admins).
